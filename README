The echowaves.com is a YACT -- Yet Another Collaboration Tool. Why one more? After all we already have http://meebo.com and http://campfire.com and many other like http://facebook.com and such. They all are great, but... non of them fits our needs 100%, and non of them is open-source.

Basically this tool could be an important addition to an agile team, specially to a geographically distributed one. We all know the importance of communication which could be difficult if people are not in the same room, or when someone walks out for few minutes...

If you'd like to contribute, perhaps start  by picking a task from the TODO list at:

=== INSTALL (localhost)
copy config/database.yml-sample to config/database.yml and modify to taste (see below for some hints on different platforms)
rake gems:install   # automaticall installs gems referenced in config/environment.rb
rake db:create      # creates the development database
rake db:migrate     # creates tables in dev DB

=== SERVERSIDE COMPONENT INSTALL
note: the application generally works without this part, but will incur a fixed delay which is configurable in environment.rb as REFRESH_FREQUINCY in seconds

* install python
sudo apt-get install python2.5-dev
sudo apt-get install python2.5-twisted


* install orbited http://orbited.org/wiki/Installation
* install simplejson
easy_install simplejson

* install stomp gem
sudo gem install stomp
(stomp gem will be prompted for by the entry in config/environment.rb)



=== POST INSTALL
SignUp a user. Activate the user by copy-pasting the activation URL from the debug log into an address of your browser and hit enter. 

To actually get the actionmailer stuff sent, you'll need to change the SMTP settings in config/environment.rb
In that case, you'll probably want to comment out the (currently last) line in config/environments/development.rb that reads "config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false", so that actionmailer failures are more visible.

Specific advice for different platforms and setups
--------------------------------------------------
WINDOWS
-------
To use this with MySQL, you will probably need to uncomment the lines in the database.yml file that say "Host: 127.0.0.1".  The error when this isn't put in is *not* particularly helpful, so if you're having trouble, give it a try.

SQLITE3
-------
change the "adapter" lines to read "adapter: sqlite3"
make the database lines something like "database: db/development.sqlite3" and "database: db/test.sqlite3"
